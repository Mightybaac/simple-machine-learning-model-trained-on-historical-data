This is a C++ program that uses the machine learning library mlpack to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to predict future stock prices. The program first loads stock data from a CSV file, normalizes the prices and volumes, and sets up the input and output data for the RNN. The input data consists of past prices, and the output data consists of the next price. The program then creates an RNN model with a specified number of inputs, hidden units, layers, and outputs, and trains the model on the input and output data for a specified number of epochs. Finally, the program uses the trained model to predict future stock prices. The program uses the Eigen library for linear algebra operations and the RNN class from mlpack's ann module for the RNN model. The program uses MeanSquaredError as the loss function.
